# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

First of all, thanks for thinking of contributing to this project. :smile:

Before sending a Pull Request, please make sure that you're assigned the task on a GitHub issue.
If not, wait for the issue to be assigned to you.
  - A relevant issue already exists, discuss on the issue and get it assigned to yourself on GitHub.
  - If you have a nice idea which you would want to implement, raise the issue 1st and describe in short why you want the implement that(2-3 lines). If it's convincing, the issue will be assigned to you.

Please proceed with a Pull Request only after you're assigned. It'd be sad if your Pull Request (and your hardwork) isn't accepted just because it isn't ideologically compatible.

##### After issue has been assigned to you :-

- See to it that master of forked repository shouldn't be ahead in terms of commits as compared to original master repository.
- Create a new branch and make changes on the new branch. Don't directly edit master repository.
- Make sure every issue you work on is done on a different branch and give those branch suitable name.
- Only one file per PR will be merged. If unnecessary commits exist, it won't be merged.
- Comments are a must. Add as many as possible and also provide a suitable title to the pull request.
- Mention the issue number while submitting a PR
